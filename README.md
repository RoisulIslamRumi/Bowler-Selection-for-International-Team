## About
Bowler Selection for Bangladesh's International Cricket Team from past data. Four machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes have been used for solving the problem. 

## Dataset
We manually extracted all our information from a website called espncricinfo. This is the best-known origin we can gather our information from. We collected our data in five different sections which include Batsmen, Bowlers, All-Rounders, Captains, and Wicket-Keepers. We listed matches played in the 2017-2018 session in the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League for batsman, bowler, and all-rounder. We primarily go through all the matches that were played in that session and collect all the information by inputting them manually in Excel file by their playing position.

## Goal
Pick the bowlers for the international cricket team of Bangladesh.
